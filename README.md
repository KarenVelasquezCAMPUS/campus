# campus

Welcome to my repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects and assignments completed during my 10-month bootcamp at **CampusLands**. Each project is carefully organized into separate branches based on its classification, making it easy to navigate and explore the various technologies and concepts I have learned.

Throughout the bootcamp, I gained hands-on experience with a range of programming languages and tools, including:

- **PHP**: Server-side scripting and dynamic web development.
- **C#**: Object-oriented programming and application development.
- **HTML/CSS**: Building structured, responsive, and visually appealing web pages.
- **JavaScript**: Client-side scripting, interactivity, and logic implementation.
- **Bootstrap**: Front-end framework for creating responsive designs quickly.

These projects reflect my journey from having no prior experience in programming to mastering the skills necessary to secure a job in techâ€”all in less than a year! I am proud to showcase both class projects and individual exercises like *push-up* challenges, demonstrating my growth and dedication to the learning process.

Feel free to explore each branch to see the different aspects of my work, and I hope it provides insight into what I've accomplished during this intensive and rewarding program.
